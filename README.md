# STUDIUM

Hi! I'm Harshal, the main (and only) developer of Studium. Studium is a website that I created for students to share notes. Studium is developed to be accessible to people of all walks of life, it requires little internet and is completely free. Studium is also completely private, and does not log any of the users' data.

### About the site

This site is almost 100% HTML. This allows the website to be really fast as it requires little downloading of data. This also aids people with unstable or slow internet connections to still reach this website. I am also looking for other ways to improve the accessibility of the site (e.g., translating webpages).

### About the content

The information on this site does not follow a certain syllabus or so. Hence, students that study different syllabuses can still use this site. The site also allows people to add their own content. This allows teh site to grow easily.
